for i in range(0, 10):
  # do something

i = 0
while(i < 10):
  # do something
  i = i + 1

And the only other tip I'd give you is: since you don't need to save what the increases are, you could do this for the second half:

increasedCount = 0
# for each average (skipping the first one)...
for k in range(1, len(depthAvgs)):
  # if it's greater than the one before it, note that
  if depthAvgs[k] > depthAvgs[k-1]:
    increasedCount += 1
(x += 1 is the same as x = x + 1)



list = []
with open("filename") as f:
    list = [line for line in f.readlines()]

the "with X as Y:" syntax is called a context manager and it's a nicer way of saying "when i'm done with this block, close/free Y", where Y can be a file or socket or other resource
